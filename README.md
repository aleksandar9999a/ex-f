<h1>ExF - TS</h1>

<p>ExF - TS is TypeScript/JavaScript Library for building Custom Web Components. Its purpose is to refine Web Components and present a cool way for their composing.</p>
</div>

<div align="center">
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
In the next few lines I will list some of the features that ExF combines to gain his super powers.
</p>


- [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) - This is a technology with which help I manage to combine the super powers of technologies listed below.

- [Shadow Dom](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM) - Important part of ExF is encapsulation and here the Shadow DOM intervenes.

- [Virtual Dom](https://bitsofco.de/understanding-the-virtual-dom/) - To make things easier, more sustainable and more dynamic, ExF uses Virtual Dom and updates only what is necessary.

- Virtual Styles - This is not something you could find on Google. Since it turned out to be great to be able to generate a Elements and then update them dynamically, so why not do the same with Styles?

- [TSX](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html) - It's actually JSX.

- [Decorators](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html) - When I saw decorators for first time they seemed rather strange to me. But this doesn't make them bad.

- etc...
